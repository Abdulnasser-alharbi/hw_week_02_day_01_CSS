# CSS 

## Getting Started

1) In your terminal, navigate to the `misk` folder where you keep all your classwork and homework. Fork and clone this repo inside that folder.

2) `cd` inside this folder and solve your homework.

3) If you're stuck on something for "too long" or get overly frustrated, make a comment and move on. Return to it later. You may find some later problems easier or need a break from what you're working on and set some fresh eyes on something you've been stuck on.

4) After each section (even if you're not fully done with it), *add* and *commit* your work.

7) When you are done with your homework, push it to your `origin` (this is your Github) and make a pull request on our repo.

>Final note: You are not alone! Everyone else in the class is working on this as well. Send Slack messages, make a Zoom channel, or meet with the TA to discuss sticking points.
